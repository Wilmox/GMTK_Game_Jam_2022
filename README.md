# GMTK_Game_Jam_2022  
*Participation of the Game Jam 2022 hosted by Game Maker's Tool Kit*  
  
The goal of the game is to influence the automatic boardgame. At the pawns turn, 2 dice will roll onto the board.
You will have 20 seconds to find and roll around the dice. This will influence the events happening to the pawn. 
Some events will influence the money and score of the pawn. 
Let's see if you help the pawn or make their existence a pain :^)

Please note that a trampoline is placed in the map in order to get up to the top of the buildings.
